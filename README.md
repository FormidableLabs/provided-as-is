## What is it? 🤔

By leveraging Formidable’s ❤️ for Open Source, we want to create a **safe space** for maintainers to meet **every quarter** in London, UK 🇬🇧

Working with Open Source requires a set of skills around the core coding one that most people find themselves sort of stumbling on; and most times this role is a bit **isolating** (there are not many projects where devs are in the same town/ have a chance to meet regularly).

This gathering wants to give an opportunity to these people to connect with each other, and **share** struggles and experiences and strategies - to do this, we will only have lighting talks (circa one per event, at the start) and give at least half the time of the event to group discussions 👐

## Cool! What's the format? ✍️

Participants can propose topics of conversation using the dedicated issue per event - we will follow, for the discussion section of the event, the [Open Space Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology) approach, paired with the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/chatham-house-rule#).

There will be food & drinks, and the participants should all be maintainers/developers/PMs involved in OSS (no recruiters). This is **not** meant to be mainstream, for showing off. We aim to have no more than 40/50 people showing up per event.

Consistency and creating a community is key here - we should aim to create an environment for OSS cross-pollination 🤗

Less frequently, once or twice a year, we will also organise "social events", which could span from a full dinner to just a pub night - to provide this community a more relaxed environment to spend time together (compared to the more serious/standard events) 🥂

## How do I participate? 🙌

Simple - register for the event via the dedicated Eventbrite page! It is **necessary** in order to provide tickets to all the participants.

We will ensure a dedicated number of tickets for underrepresented groups in the dev community - you will be able to apply for them via the Eventbrite page.

## How can I help? 🤗

Great question! We have created a dedicated section

## Who is behind this? 🧐

Your friendly neighborhood Formidable UK team, in collaboration with XXX (TBC).

## Are you going to do this event in [my city]?

No, not for the foreseeable future - we are aiming to create a local community. But if you like this format idea, feel free to fork this repo and organise your own local "Provided As Is" meetup 🤗

And let us know, we'd love to hear what your experience is!
