## What is it? ü§î

By leveraging Formidable‚Äôs involvement in Open Source, we want to create a **safe space** for maintainers to meet **every quarter**.

Working with Open Source requires a set of skills around the core coding one that most people find themselves sort of stumbling on; and most times this role is a bit **isolating** (there are not many projects where devs are in the same town/ meet regularly).

This gathering wants to give an opportunity to these people to connect with each other, and **share** struggles and experiences and strategies - to do this, we will only have lighting talks (circa one per event, at the start) and give at least half the time of the event to group discussions.

## Cool! What's the format? ‚úçÔ∏è

Participants can propose topics of conversation using the dedicated issue per event - we will follow, for the discussion section of the event, the [Open Space Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology) approach, paired with the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/chatham-house-rule#).

There will be food & drinks, and the people coming should all be maintainers/developers/PMs involved in OSS. This is **not** meant to be mainstream, for showing off. We aim to have no more than 40/50 people showing up per event.

Consistency and creating a community is key here - we should aim to create an environment for OSS cross-pollination ü§ó

Less frequently, once or twice a year, we will also organise "social events", which could span from a full dinner to just a pub night - to provide this community a more relaxed environment to spend time together (compared to the more serious/standard events).
